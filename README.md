Chrome Extension for blocking trolls on rofo.

currently quick and dirty

Known issues:
-sometimes it cannot block certain posts.  CL is inconsistent with the source code for the forum posts.  I'm not sure if they do this on purpose or a bug on their side.  No matter, I'll eventually fix this issue.

To use:
1. download all the files and put them on your disk somewhere.   

2.  Open the file block.js and add desired handle names to the trolls list at the top.  (make sure you quote them and end each line with a comma, just like the existing ones.

3.  Go to chrome extensions (settings->extensions)
4.  enable "developer mode" in the upper right
5.  click "Load unpacked extension" button and select director where you downloaded it.
6.  If you need to add to the troll list, edit block.js and go back to the extension settings and click "Reload".
